        SUPERB is the first AI-native hedge fund designed entirely on‑chain and built for the Base ecosystem. At its core
        is a self‑adjusting agent that analyzes token launches, liquidity shifts, and behavioural patterns across the
        network, reallocating capital in real time without human intervention. Users participate by vesting
        <span class="text-primary font-medium">$SUPERB</span>, unlocking a continuous stream of <span class="text-primary font-medium">$SUPERBx</span>, a
        Superfluid‑powered yield token that reflects their share of protocol performance. No dashboards to micromanage.
        No active trades to track. Just transparent, programmable investing built for the next generation of onchain
        users.
